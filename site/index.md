AdSlicerProXP is a fully automated advertisement detection and removal system built for long-form VHS captures, analog transfers, and TV recordings. It analyzes black slugs between program segments, determines likely commercial blocks. The pipeline is robust, batch-friendly, and designed for noisy, variable analog sources. It is optimized for unstable analog media where black slugs vary in length and clarity.

AdSlicerProXP provides a production-grade workflow to:

- detect black gaps between content and commercials,  
- merge, filter, and classify black segments into ad intervals,  
- extract the show and ads with precise time boundaries,  
- generate reproducible logs for auditing and QC,  
- run as a batch processor across directories of mixed recordings.
